# Pain Management Portal

## Description
For this project, we took the problem of pain and opioid
addiction and created an online portal for medical providers
and patients to easily track treatment plans. A portal like
this makes it easier for providers to keep track of patients
and adjust medication with recorded data that prevents malpractice.

## Motivation
The idea of this comes from a personal venture to treat pain
through the use of virtual reality. I’ve been working on a program to offer a
distraction based VR therapy that works by taking the patient’s mind away
from the hospital setting. A way to measure results is necessary for programs
like these in the medical field and an online portal like this could benefit that program.

## Results
A functioning web app that supports Google Custom Search and Fitbit APIs, as well as Firebase realtime database support.
